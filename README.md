# Feather Calendar

A lightweight, **pinnable desktop calendar** that won't get in your way during meetings.
It's a simple and fast Windows application that you can quickly open when you need it and close when you're done.

## What is Feather Calendar?

"When should we schedule the next meeting?" This is a common question during web conferences.
The default OS calendar disappears when you click on another window, and full-featured schedulers like Outlook can be overkill when all you want to do is **just check a date**.

Feather Calendar was created to solve these minor frustrations.
By completely **removing scheduling features** and focusing solely on **providing a quick way to view dates**, it offers a level of lightness and convenience that other calendars don't.

## How is it different from other calendars?

To clarify its position, here's a feature comparison with major calendar applications.

| Feature | Feather Calendar | Windows Default | Google Calendar (Web) | Outlook (Desktop) |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Installation** | **◎ (Not Required)** | ◎ (OS Integrated) | ◎ (Not Required) | ✕ (Required) |
| **Startup Speed / Lightweight** | **◎** | ○ | △ (Browser dependent) | ✕ |
| **Always on Top (Pinnable)** | **◎** | ✕ | ✕ | ✕ |
| **Stays Visible (Doesn't disappear)** | **◎** | ✕ | ○ (Tab/Window) | ○ (Window) |
| **Multi-Month View** | **◎ (1/3 Months Switchable)** | ✕ (1 Month) | ○ | ○ |
| **Scheduling / Sync** | **✕ (Not Supported)** | ○ (Limited) | ◎ | ◎ |

As this table shows, Feather Calendar is a specialized tool for "quick date reference," not "event management."

## Features

- 🚀 **No Installation Required**: Just unzip the file and run the `.exe`. It doesn't clutter your registry.

## Use Cases

- Scheduling meetings during web conferences or online classes.
- Keeping a calendar permanently visible on a secondary monitor.
- For developers who need to quickly check dates and days of the week.

## How to Use

### Getting Started
1.  **Download**: Get the latest zip file from the **[Releases page](https://github.com/FlatBone/feather-calendar/releases)**.

### Usage
#### View Mode Selection
The calendar starts in 3-month view by default. Click the view mode button (showing "3ヶ月" or "1ヶ月") in the header to switch between:

- **3-Month View**: Comprehensive view showing previous, current, and next months

The window size automatically adjusts when switching between view modes.

#### Calendar View
In 3-month view, the calendar displays the previous, current, and next months based on today's date.
In 1-month view, only the current month is displayed in a centered, compact layout.

Click the arrow buttons next to "Today" to change the displayed month. Click the "Today" button to return to the default view.

#### Pinning (Always on Top)
You'll find the "Pin" button to the right of the month navigation controls. Click it to keep the calendar always on top of other windows. Click the button again to unpin it.

## System Requirements

## For Developers

### How to Build

To build this application from the source code, follow these steps.

1.  **Set up the Rust environment.**

    The easiest way is to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

    ```bash
    # Installs rustup and the default toolchain
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

    **For Windows (MSVC) users:**
    The `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` toolchain requires the Microsoft C++ Build Tools. Please install them via the [Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
    In the installer, select the "C++ build tools" workload.

    After installation, it is recommended to run the build commands in the **Developer Command Prompt for VS** to ensure all necessary environment variables are set correctly.

2.  **Clone this repository.**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/FlatBone/feather-calendar.git
    cd feather-calendar
    ```

3.  **Build the application.**

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

      Once the build is complete, the executable will be located at `target/release/feather_calendar.exe`.
